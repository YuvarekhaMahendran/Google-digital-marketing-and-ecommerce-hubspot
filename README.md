HubSpot allows users to manage all their marketing channel activity in one place. When it comes to email marketing, you can use HubSpot for many different email marketing tasks. 
First, you set a goal for your business. Next, you manage your contact database and segment those contacts. Then, you create personalized and targeted emails and decide when each user should receive those emails by selecting the delay time between email sends. You test your emails, and finally, you analyze your email performance. Before you send your email, preview it by clicking the Actions dropdown menu, and select Preview. In the Devices tab, you can preview the email on desktop and mobile. You can even opt to view the email as each particular contact. To do that, click the Preview as specific contact dropdown. 
After you’ve tested your email, you’re ready to send it. At the top of the screen, click the Send or schedule button. Click the Send to dropdown and add the list(s) you wish to send the email to. To ensure you exclude subscribers you don’t want the email to go to, add them to the Don’t send to dropdown. 
You can either Send your email now or you can Schedule for later.
